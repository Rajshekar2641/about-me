            Hi,my name is Rajashekar Gande and I am doing my masters in Applied Computer Science in Northwest Missouri
            State University. I am from India after completing my under graduation where my major is Electronics and
            Communication in 2017. Later I worked as a qualitative analyst in HGS Company in Hyderabad which is not
            related
            to the course, so I consider myself as a fresher.

                <h3 style="font-size: 25px;">FUTURE</h3>
                My expectations through this course are really high such as to see myself as a senior web developer and
                also if
                possible I would like to become an entreprenuer because I am really interested and focused to move to
                that
                position. But for that I need to work really hard on my course and lectures. Having such a big goal I am
                ready
                to face the challenges and I think probably i could overcome those difficulties with the help of the my
                professors and students over here.
