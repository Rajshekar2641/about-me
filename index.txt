ajashekar Gande-44563-Dr. Case- section 2 (10 AM)

current

                 Hello,my name is Rajashekar Gande and I am doing my master's in Applied Computer Science in Northwest Missouri State University. I am from India after completing my under graduation where my major is Electronics and Communication in 2017. Later I worked as a qualitative analyst in HGS Company in Hyderabad which is not related to the course, so I consider myself as a fresher.
future

                My expectations through this course are really high such as to see myself as a senior web developer and also if possible I would like to become an entreprenuer because I am really interested and focused to move to that position. But for that I need to work really hard on my course and lectures. Having such a big goal I am ready to face the challenges and I think probably i could overcome those difficulties with the help of the my professors and students over here.
